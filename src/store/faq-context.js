Use Mitt & Brush to apply to tricky areas like the feet, hands, face & ears.<br />4. Use the Back Tan Applicator to apply the tan evenly across your back.<br />5. Allow to develop for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight for a deeper tan.<br />6. Shower in warm water to remove the guide colour and pat skin dry.<br />7. Repeat every 5-7 days or when needed. Moisturise daily to maintain results.',

It is nourishing, hydrating and contains ingredients that will not clog pores and cause breakouts. <br />We do advise doing a skin patch test before applying a full body tan. If the skin patch test shows no negative signs, it is safe to use a full-body tan.<br />Avoid applying the tan to areas with broken skin or skin which is showing signs of aggravation. ',
