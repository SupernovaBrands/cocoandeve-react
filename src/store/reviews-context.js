Applying to feet is a little tricky but nothing you can't get the hang of after a few applications. Smells great too! I love the hair towel and the cute little eye mask!</p>",

The first photo was taken immediately after tanning one leg. The second was taken after a few hours and both legs were tanned.</p>",

Such a great way to get the perfect tan without causing skin damage or possible skin cancer. The photo shows the difference between my natural paleness and this amazing product.</p>",
